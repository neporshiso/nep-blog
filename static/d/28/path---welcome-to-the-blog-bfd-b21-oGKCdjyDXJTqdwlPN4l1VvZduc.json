This first post summarizes who I am and the purpose of this project.</p>\n<!-- end -->\n<h2>About Me</h2>\n<p> My name is Nep Orshiso and I’m from Kansas City, MO. I’m an Ethiopian-American and I’ve lived in the Midwest most of my life. I have a B.S. in Finance and Marketing and a minor in Economics from Truman State University.</p>\n<p>I moved to Atlanta, GA to join the DigitalCrafts Full-Time Immersive Program to become a software developer. Previously, I worked at a large retirement services provider as a junior manager in their call center. I aim to become a Software Developer in January 2020 in Atlanta after completing the DigitalCrafts program.\nInterests</p>\n<p>Technology, Personal Finance, Economics, and Politics are subjects that interest me. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of technology and finance.</p>\n<p>I’m also a big fan of podcasts. They make commuting and exercise bearable.</p>\n<p>My Favorite Podcasts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NPR: Planet Money &#x26; The Indicator</li>\n<li>Freakonomics</li>\n<li>Animal Spirits</li>\n<li>FiveThirtyEight</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I like watching football and soccer. Being from Missouri, I’m a fan of the Kansas City Chiefs. Mahomes is the real deal. I also support Arsenal in the English Premier League.</p>\n<h2>Tech Background &#x26; Choosing DigitalCrafts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Motavera\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gxzF3Z9cgg\" title=\"Motavera Pitch\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/1gxzF3Z9cgg/0.jpg\" alt=\"Motavera Pitch\"></a></li>\n<li>Python at Truman</li>\n<li>Choosing DigitalCrafts</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Purpose of the Blog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Become a better writer and communicator</li>\n<li>Document important material learned</li>\n<li>Technical Topics</li>\n<li>Document projects, learnings, and challenges</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s free and easy to get started.
