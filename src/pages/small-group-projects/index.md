Sharing my observations on how to make small group projects work well.

<!-- end -->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you’re in a coding bootcamp, you will most likely find yourself working in a team to build something together. You may be someone who would rather work alone but the reality is that software development in a professional setting is usually done in teams. Working with others is an important skill and I wanted to share some of the things I’ve experienced from my undergraduate days and my current experience in the DigitalCrafts bootcamp that led to a pleasant group project experience.

I believe a group that works well together has three of the following characteristics.

### 1. Agreement on the End Goal

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team understands the requirements from the instructor, teacher, etc. It's simple but needs to be said. There's absolutely no problem going above and beyond the baseline, but you should make sure to try and get that baseline completed. Whatever the group decides for the project, the members need to buy-in to the end goal. If there is disagreement on what the project should look like and that isn’t addressed before diving into the work phase, that is a recipe for disaster.

### 2. Open Communication

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone says communication is an important skill but what exactly does it mean? The way I kind of define it is being able to say what’s on your mind without making people feel attacked. In other words, sharing what’s on your mind in a respectful manner goes a long way in making progress.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every one on the team should have access to a shared resource with work related to the project so the team can stay in sync e.g Trello, Google Drive, Github. On a similar vein, the group should have a chat with only the members of that team in it e.g Slack, GroupMe, etc. This will help keep you organized and not mix personal or other work inside your group project.

### 3. Mutual Respect

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one goes without saying. Being civil and courteous to your teammates and not gossiping helps cohesion. Respect is important in a team. Imagine trying to get work done in a group where different points of view are shut down in an unprofessional manner. You don’t really need to work with people that you are best friends with but people who are dependable, contribute, and don’t cause unnecessary drama.

## Project Phases

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team project is usually broken down into three phases. The first stage is the brainstorming phase; where the ideas flow to determine what app or product to build. The second stage is the work phase; actually building and collaborating on the final product. And lastly, the presentation stage; showing off your work to your cohort.

### Brainstorming Phase

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this phase, ideas are proposed for what the product should look like. It’s important to not ever attack the person behind the idea but to constructively critizise the idea itself. Don’t get personally wrapped up in your own idea because the rest of the team may be able to spot potential downfalls that you may not see. In fact, that’s one of the positives of working in a team. Ideas can be stress tested and improved. Conflict around ideas is not bad and is what should happen when brainstorming. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s important in this phase to also speak up when you feel that the team is going in a direction you think is not good. It's much easier to change course in this phase as the momentum hasn't picked up yet. The longer you wait in speaking up, the higher the chance you may find yourself in a situation where you’re begrudgingly working on a project that you don’t care about or identify with. It’s more fun when everyone has buy-in and the project is a reflection of each of the team members contributions. Speak up and make yourself heard. No one can advocate for your positions besides yourself.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, if you really want to be efficient, already have an idea saved and propose that to your team. Sometimes your group will just go for it and jump straight into the work phase as it saves the time and consternation of first coming up with an idea in the first place!

### Work Phase

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the name suggests, this is where the rubber meets the road. You’ve already figured out what to build but now you’re concerned with how to build it. This phase is all about collaboration, coordination, and completing tasks.

In the previous phase, you should have determined what your "dream" product looks like and all the cool features it contains. Now, strip it down to the bare essentials. What's the smallest subset of functionality that you can ship that gives people a rough idea of what the final product will do. You do not have time to build a fully-featured application.

When you have a slimmed down version, sometimes called a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), structure your work around getting those features built and implemented by the project deadline.

I've had a lot of success on group projects using a Trello or Github Projects Board with four columns. 
1. MVP Backlog - List of Work Items that need to be completed by the deadline
2. In Progress - Work items currently being developed
3. Done - Completed Work Items
4. Stretch Goals - A place to store the "nice-to-have" features. They're not mission critical but would be cool to have in the product by deadline.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try and get a rough MVP done and working a day or so before the deadline to decrease stress before attempting stretch features.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small team, there is no excuse for poor communication. When all of the group can easily fit in a small room, everyone should be kept on the same page. One pattern I’ve used in several projects is in the morning, prioritize which tasks are the most important, discuss any blockers, break out and work individually, and then circle back at the end of the day to sync up individual work. It’s important to have a goal set for the day for what you want completed. At the end of the day, discuss what if anything needs to be done by the start of the new day and rinse repeat until deadline.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t be afraid to reach out to your team when stuck. It’s much better in my opinion to try and solve your problem on your own for 30 minutes or so but if it’s taking you longer than that, reach out to your teammates as there’s a good chance they’ve experienced a similar problem. Simply having an extra set of eyes on your issue can help get you unstuck.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this phase, I strongly believe that team members need to have individual tasks that they are accountable for. This will give you some thing to talk about in the presentation phase. This also decreases the likelihood that the work won’t get done since someone is held accountable for it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm heavily editorializing with this last point but I don't think some members of the group should be siloed to just the HTML/CSS. We all have our strengths and weaknesses but I think everyone should at least have the opportunity to affect all aspects of the project. Obviously, this decision will be made by your team and not myself. I've noticed that there can be a tendency to “protect” your portion of the project but that behavior is unnecessary and unrealistic as your primary objective is to learn how to collaborate. If you’re not happy with how the project turns out, you can always fork the repository and do it your own way.

### Presentation Phase

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your group will most likely get the opportunity to present the project to the rest of your cohort and the instructor will probably make each individual speak. Getting up in front of a room of people and presenting your work can be uncomfortable and downright scary but this is great practice for communicating in a professional environment. The classroom is really practice for the workplace; it's important to get your speaking reps in now when the stakes are low in the classroom setting.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual tasks that you were accountable for will actually make it easier during the presentation. Make sure to either jot down or make a mental note of your individual contributions as well as your struggles and how you overcame them. This will help avoid the last minute scramble of trying to figure out, "what exactly am I going to talk about?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s useful to speak about your contributions and impact to the team. This is essentially what you will be doing when you’re sitting at the interview table with an employer and they’re asking you about your previous work and project history.

## Conclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, people have different personalities but I believe you can work together with almost any one if there is agreement on the end goal, open communication, and mutual respect amongst teammates. The above information isn’t rocket science but I hope you found something about it useful!
