Welcome to Nep's blog. This first post summarizes who I am and the purpose of this project.

<!-- end -->

## About Me
 My name is Nep Orshiso and I'm from Kansas City, MO. I'm an Ethiopian-American and I've lived in the Midwest most of my life. I have a B.S. in Finance and Marketing and a minor in Economics from Truman State University.

I moved to Atlanta, GA to join the DigitalCrafts Full-Time Immersive Program to become a software developer. Previously, I worked at a large retirement services provider as a junior manager in their call center. I aim to become a Software Developer in January 2020 in Atlanta after completing the DigitalCrafts program.
Interests

Technology, Personal Finance, Economics, and Politics are subjects that interest me. Iâ€™m particularly interested in the intersection of technology and finance.

I'm also a big fan of podcasts. They make commuting and exercise bearable.

My Favorite Podcasts:

* NPR: Planet Money & The Indicator
* Freakonomics
* Animal Spirits
* FiveThirtyEight

I like watching football and soccer. Being from Missouri, I'm a fan of the Kansas City Chiefs. Mahomes is the real deal. I also support Arsenal in the English Premier League.

## Tech Background & Choosing DigitalCrafts

* Motavera 
[![Motavera Pitch](http://img.youtube.com/vi/1gxzF3Z9cgg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gxzF3Z9cgg "Motavera Pitch")

I may write a post on how that company was started and how it failed. We wrote a post-mortem and I think it's kind of interesting.

* Python at Truman
I took a Python class at Truman which helped establish a base foundation for my DigitalCrafts experience.

* Choosing DigitalCrafts
Why I decided to quit my job and pursue learning full-time. DigitalCrafts was highly ranked. Wanted to move to Atlanta, wanted to move into Tech. What's the best software development bootcamp in Atlanta?

## Purpose of the Blog

* Document projects, learnings, and challenges
* Technical Topics
* Become a better writer and communicator
* Play with React/Gatsby

It's free and easy to get started. I may write my next post on how I'm using React/Gatsby Template hosted on Netlify as a guide to other students who want to get started. My goal is to write one post a month minimum.
